JBoss Fuse
----------

Security Prerequisites
----------------------
By default, no users are defined for the container. You can run the container in the
foreground in this case, but you will not be able to access the container remotely
and you will not be able to run it in the background.

To enable remote access to the container, you must create at least one user in
the ./etc/users.properties file. It is recommended that you create at least one user
with the admin role by adding a line with the following syntax:

<Username>=<Password>,admin

The admin role grants full administration privileges to the user.

Quick Start
-----------
To start JBoss Fuse 6.3.0.redhat-187, run 'bin/fuse' on
